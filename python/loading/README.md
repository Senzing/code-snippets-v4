# Loading Data

The loading snippets outline adding new source records. Adding source records ingests [mapped](https://senzing.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/231925448-Generic-Entity-Specification-JSON-CSV-Mapping) JSON data, completes the entity resolution process and persists outcomes in the Senzing repository. Adding a source record with the same data source code and record ID as an existing record will replace it.
